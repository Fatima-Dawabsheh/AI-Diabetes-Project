Medical Diagnosis of Diabetes Using Machine Learning
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning-based system to classify and diagnose diabetes based on patient symptoms. Using Python (scikit-learn) and Weka, multiple classification algorithms were trained and evaluated to determine the most effective model for diabetes prediction.
